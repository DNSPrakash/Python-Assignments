Problem Statement: "Given a string, check if the string is palindrome or not."  A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: Str =  “ABCDCBA”
Output: Palindrome
Explanation: String when reversed is the same as string.

Example 2:
Input: Str = “TAKE U FORWARD”
Output: Not Palindrome
Explanation: String when reversed is not the same as string.

str=input("Enter the Word: ")
print("Palindrome") if str==str[::-1] else print("Not palindrome")



Problem Statement: Given a string, write a program to count the number of vowels, consonants, and spaces in that string.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: string str=”Take u forward is Awesome”
Output: 
Vowels: 10
Consonants: 11
White spaces: 4

word=input("Enter the Sentence: ")
countv=0
countc=0
spaces=0
for i in word:
    if i in "aeiouAEIOU":
        countv+=1
    elif (i>="a" and i<="z") or (i>="A" and i<="Z"):
        countc+=1
    elif i==" ":
        spaces+=1
print(f"Vowels:{countv}\nConsonents:{countc}\nWhite Spaces:{spaces}")
